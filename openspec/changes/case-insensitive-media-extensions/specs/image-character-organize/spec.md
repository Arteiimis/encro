## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Command surface and scanning

`encro organize <directory>` SHALL scan the directory for still-image files (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.webp`), skipping the `organized/` output tree itself. The set is matched case-insensitively (`media-scan`), so uppercase and mixed-case spellings of these extensions are scanned too. Scanning SHALL be non-recursive by default and recursive with `-r/--recursive`; the `recursive` config key applies with the standard CLI > config > default precedence, and the built-in default is non-recursive. An empty scan result SHALL exit 0 with a message stating that no images were found. A nonexistent or unreadable target directory SHALL exit non-zero with an error naming the path. The subcommand help SHALL state that analysis is local and that images are not uploaded.

#### Scenario: Default scan excludes subdirectories and output tree

- **WHEN** the target directory contains images directly, images in a subdirectory, and an `organized/` tree from a previous run
- **THEN** only the images directly in the target directory are processed

#### Scenario: Uppercase image extensions are scanned

- **WHEN** the target directory contains an image named `PHOTO.JPG`
- **THEN** the image is scanned and processed like its lowercase spelling

#### Scenario: Recursive flag includes subdirectories

- **WHEN** `encro organize <dir> -r` runs over a tree that also contains an `organized/` output tree
- **THEN** images under subdirectories are processed and the `organized/` tree is still excluded

#### Scenario: No images found

- **WHEN** the target directory contains no supported image files
- **THEN** the command exits 0 and prints a message that no images were found

#### Scenario: Nonexistent directory fails

- **WHEN** `encro organize` runs against a directory that does not exist or cannot be read
- **THEN** the command exits non-zero with an error naming the directory
